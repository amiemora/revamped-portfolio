Are you Yello? 
"The first words that consistently come to mind when people see the color yellow are “sunshine”, “warmth”, “cheer”, “happiness” and sometimes even “playfulness."

Our Yellow themed social media app is separate from any other because it is centered around the sensation of feeling happy and spreading that happiness througout the platform. The purpose of this social app is to share happiness. Instagram shares the bests parts - Yello shares the happiness which is more real than any other post.
